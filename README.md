# COUNTRIES CLI APP

This program was created to help people get quick access to basic information such as capital, population, language(s), currency, region, and sub-region on any country in the world. 
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

Fork and clone this repository to your local machine. Save it somewhere it'll be easy to find, like on your Desktop. Then you want to open your terminal application:

If you saved the file in your Desktop type this in your Terminal
```
cd Desktop/project_countries_cli
```

If you saved the file in another folder, follow the same path procedure. From here you can go to USAGE.

### Usage 

At this step you should already be in your terminal and in the project directory. If not go back to INSTALLING.

In the terminal enter the following command:

```
ruby bin/countries
```
You'll be welcomed to the program and given instructions:

```
Hello and welcome to my COUNTRIES APP!
 
Enter a name of a country to get more information about it.
..Enter 'list' to SELECT from a list of all the countries IN THE WORLD.
...Or Enter 'exit' to exit! 
```
